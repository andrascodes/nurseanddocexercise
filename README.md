# Nurse & Doc Front End Test Task - Weather

The demo is available [here]("https://andrewszucs.github.io/nurseanddocexercise").

Forked from [Matt Kendall's repository](https://gitlab.com/matt.kendall/weather).
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a React app to show the current weather
in a given city. The user should be able to enter the city name and they you should
show the current weather for the named city. If there are multiple cities found
that match the entered city name, the user should be presented with a list of
choices. After selecting a choice, the current weather for the choice should
be retrieved and shown to the user.

## API

The weather API to use in order to get the data is [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
In order to use the API, you must create a free API key. Note that the API key takes about an
hour to activate, so be sure to sign-up for the key in advance of doing the task.
Please review the [API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to see how to retrieve
the current weather.
